# PiTimelapse

Timelapse photography with the Raspberry Pi camera.

## Summary

A long-term time lapse is an effective and fun way to communicate changes over time. However, most cameras which are custom-built to capture time lapse videos are very costly. While DSLRs are able to capture photos at set intervals, the images captured cannot be accessed (without purchasing additional equipment) until the entire set of photos. Our project captures the individual frames of a time-lapse video with cheap, reliable, off-the-shelf components, with the added benefit of allowing one to review and work with the images as they are being captured by uploading the images to Dropbox.

## Other Work

Plenty of work has already been done in the field of time-lapse photography, including an [Instructables Site](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-long-term-time-lapse/), an amazing [Vimeo video](http://www.photographyblogger.net/a-year-long-time-lapse-study-of-the-sky/), and a [project by David Hunt](http://www.davidhunt.ie/raspberry-pi-in-a-dslr-camera/) using a Raspberry Pi to control a DSLR camera
